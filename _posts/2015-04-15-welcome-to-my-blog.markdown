What's up, folks. 

First let me introduce myself:
my name is Lucas, I'm a software developer who currently lives in Brazil. I'm VERY passionate
about what I do and that's the reason I'm starting
this blog.

Here I'm gonna talk about things I'm experimenting
in general. Some of my main interests are: Functional Programming, free software, Agile Development and new technologies.

Hope you enjoy! That's all for now.
