What's up folks!

Today I'm here just to present you guys my newest project.I've been using Linux as my main OS for three years now, so I decided to make a cool static website to serve to gather around some useful stuff I have learned through all of these years and to help newcomers on easily follow through some basic/medium concepts and commands on Linux/Shell/Bash.

So here I present you:

If you spot some mistakes or want to add new stuff I invite you to contribute!

Hope you enjoy it.
